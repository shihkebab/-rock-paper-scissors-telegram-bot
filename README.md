A simple bot for playing "stone, scissors,

## Installation and startup
1. Go to the official Python website(**[click](https://www.python.org/**)**) and download the latest version. 

    Download and install. When installing, **be sure to check "Add Python to path "**.


2. Copy or download the project code, then in the file `.env.example` insert your token obtained from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in telegram,
   **insert the token without spaces**.

   **Afterwards be sure to change the file name `.env.example` to `.env`!**


3.  Next, you need to install the necessary libraries, to do this open the console and enter the following commands in turn:
   
   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Since the bot is written in aiogram3, and this is still a beta version of the library, it must be installed with a special command ([read more here](https://docs.aiogram.dev/en/dev-3.x/install.html))
   ```
   pip install -U --pre aiogram
   ```


4. After installing all the libraries run the file `bot.py` and the bot goes online! :tada:
